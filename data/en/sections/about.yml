# a summary about you
summary: |
  I’m a Visual Researcher & Archive Producer for TV documentaries and film based in Canada.

  With over 10 years of experience working as a Visual Researcher on award winning documentaries, films, educational websites, and television broadcast media, let me expertly and efficiently source the additional images and footage your project needs. Whether you need material that’s visually impactful to wow audiences, historically or contextually accurate for factual authenticity, cheap to meet restricted budgets, or fast and easily licensable to make those tight deadlines - I’ve worked with producers, directors, editors, and researchers to help identify and satisfy their unique archive research needs.
